# Gau Platform Deployment Automation

A simple repository to easily automate and deploy the Gau Platform on different cloud environments. It supports both Kubernetes and Docker Compose, allowing smooth setup of microservices on minimal resources (1 CPU core, 2GB RAM) and can handle 200+ concurrent users. The setup is portable and easy to reuse across environments, with better performance on higher-spec servers.

---

## Getting Started

### Docker Compose Deployment

1. Navigate to the `docker-compose` directory (if available).
2. Run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
    ```
   Access services via configured ports.

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster (k3s, k3d, or standard Kubernetes).

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the Kubernetes manifests directory:
    ```bash
    cd gau_platform/k8s/production
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
3. Apply the Kubernetes manifests:
    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
4. Verify deployment and ingress.

## Configuration
- Customize environment variables via ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- Adjust resource requests and limits to optimize for your server capacity.
